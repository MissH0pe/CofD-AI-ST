# Chronicles of Darkness AI Storyteller
This is the way before pre-pre-pre-alpha release of what will hopefully allow a person or group of people to play Chronicles of darkness games without a storyteller. Currently this is a bunch of unconnected pieces of code which will later be called to make a cohesive experience and may later actually become something cool. All rights belong to White Wolf Publishing, I'm just trying to use random numbers and later fully fledged AI to make the game run itself.
